# CEA_Wrap
A Python-Based wrapper for the NASA CEA Thermochemical Code

# Installation Instructions
We are now on [PyPi!](https://pypi.org/project/CEA-Wrap/)
In a command prompt type ```pip install --upgrade CEA_Wrap``` to upgrade/install CEA_Wrap

Or you can click on "releases" on the right side of the main page and download the .zip file, then do ```pip install --upgrade [your zip file name].zip```

You can import it as any other python module with ```import CEA_Wrap```. Whenever you import the file, it will put the required thermo.lib and trans.lib files into your current directory.

# Examples
Examples on basic use can be found in the "examples" directory. Feel free to download them and try them out!

Or you can run a short demo by doing "python -m CEA_Wrap" on the command line!

# Documentation
## Utilities
  ```open_thermo_lib()```
  Opens the default thermo library input file using the user's default .inp file viewer (should prompt if none)

  ```open_pdfs()```
  Opens the attached NASA pdfs using the user's default pdf viewer

  ```print_assets_directory()```
  Prints to console the current location of the directory where CEA_Wrap assets are located. Also returns this value

## Materials
  In order to run problems, you must create materials. `Materials` must be either Fuel or Oxidizer (alias: F or O) objects

  ### Constructor Parameters - Either Fuel() or Oxidizer():
  ```Material(name, temp=298, wt_percent=None, mols=None, chemical_composition = None, hf = None):```

* `name`: required parameter, the CEA material name with correct spelling. E.G. aluminum is "AL(cr)" and methane is "CH4". 
  * If you specify chemical_composition, name can be whatever single word you want
  * If you try to specify a chemical which is not in the thermo_spg.inp file, a ValueError will be raised. To prevent this check, set `Material.check_against_thermo_inp = False`
* `temp`: default 298, specified reactant initial temperature, Kelvin
  * If you try to specify a temperature which is not supported for this material in the thermo_spg.inp file, a ValueError will be raised. To prevent this check, set `Material.check_against_thermo_inp = False`
* `wt_percent`: A weight-based percentage for the element. Weight percentages do not need to add up to 100, and are calculated on the ratio with other Fuels/Oxidizers
* `mols`: A mol-based percentage for the element. Can be used as in `Oxidizer("O2", mols=1)` and `Oxidizer("N2", mols=3.76)` for air (except CEA has "air" as a reactant...)
* **NOTE:** wt_percent and mols cannot be specified together, if neither is defined, the `Material` gets a wt_percent of 1
* `chemical_composition`: chemical composition such as "LI 1 B 1 H 4" for LiBH4. If defined, will not use CEA default values 
  * **NOTE: UNTESTED**
* `hf`:  Enthalpy of formation, kJ/kg, must be specified if chemical_composition is specified
  * **NOTE: UNTESTED**

### Available Methods
* `.set_wt_percent(wt_percent)` - Sets the wt_percent for the `Material`. Sets mols to None
* `.set_mols(mols)` - Sets the mols for the `Material`. Sets wt_percent to None
* `.set_temp(temp)` - Sets the temp for the `Material`, in Kelvin. If you try to specify a temperature which is not support for this material, a ValueError will be raised
* `.is_mols()/.is_wt_percent()` - Checks if the `Material` is set in weight % or mol ratio

## Generic Problem Methods (apply to all problems such as DetonationProblem, RocketProblem, etc.):

### Constructor Parameters (making new Problem Objects):
  ```Problem(*, **kwargs)```:
* **NOTE:** all parameters must be specified by keyword, e.g. problem = RocketProblem(pressure=500, massf=True)
* `pressure`: default 1000, Initial problem pressure
* `materials`: default None, List of `Material` objects, order doesn't matter, of Oxidizer and Fuel objects e.g. materials=[material1, material2, ...]
  * materials can also be specified when you run a problem like `problem.run_cea(material1, material2, ...)`
  * materials MUST all have wt_percent specified or all have mols specified, can't have mixtures.
* `massf`: default False, CEA usually outputs product ratios in mole ratios, if massf is True, mass ratios are specified
* `filename`: default "my_output", the filename we save our .inp files to and CEA saves our .out and .plt to.
  * DO NOT INCLUDE ".inp" IN YOUR FILENAMES. 
* `pressure_units`: default "psi", the units that your input pressure is in. Possible values are "bar", "atm", "psi", or "mmh"
* `inserts`: default None, a list of CEA names for species which should be forced into the product considerations. Should be specified as either a space-separated string of names, a list of string names, or a list of `Material` objects.
  * Note: If you try to specify a chemical which is not in the thermo_spg.inp file, a ValueError will be raised. To prevent this check, set `Problem.check_against_thermo_inp =  False` 
  * Tip: If you are doing calculations with Aluminum, I recommend using inserts=["AL2O3(L)", "AL2O3(a)"]
* `omits`: default None, a list of CEA names for species which should be specifically ignored in the product considerations. Specified similar to inserts.
* **NOTE:** You must specify one of the following reactant ratio schemes before running a problem. Either during initialization with `x=1.0` or later with `problem.set_x(1.0)` where x is p_f, o_f, etc.
#### Specifying reactant ratios:
   Key  | CEA Key | Description
  ------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   p_f  |  %f     | Percent fuel by weight
   f_o  |  f/o    | Fuel-to-oxidant weight ratio
   o_f  |  o/f    | Oxidant-to-fuel weight ratio
   phi  |  phi    | Equivalence ratios in terms of fuel-to-oxidant weight ratios (eq. (9.19) in Gordon and McBride, 1994)
   r_eq |  r      | Chemical equivalence ratios in terms of valences (eq. (9.18) in Gordon and McBride, 1994)

### Available Methods
* `data = .run([*materials])`

Run the CEA problem, returning an "Output" object, which is similar to a dictionary (keys and values specified later in this documentation)
  * Inputs are optionally `Material`s to be used in this run. If materials are not specified as an initial parameter or with .set_materials, you can list them here.

* `.set_absolute_o_f()`

Have you ever specified all your components in absolute percentages, and then have to manually calculate the o_f ratio based on what is fuel and what is oxidizer?

Well no more! Just call this function and we calculate the correct o_f ratio for you so that your absolute percentages are correctly reflected in the problem.
Functions off of the existing material list, so call this after setting materials. This works by summing wt_percent for all oxidizers and then dividing by the same for fuels. Then it sets o/f to this value.

* `.set_pressure(pressure)` - sets pressure
* `.set_materials([material1, material2, ...])` - provided a list of materials, sets the materials list
* `.set_massf(massf)` - Sets massf to True or False
* `.set_inserts(inserts)` - Set inserts to a space-separated string or list of materials or `Material`s
* `.set_omits(omits)` - Sets omits, similar to inserts
* `.set_filename(filename)` - Sets problem filename
* `.set_pressure_units(units)` - Sets input pressure units
* `.set_p_f(pf)` - Sets % Fuel for problem
* `.set_f_o(f_o)` - Sets fuel/oxidizer ratio
* `.set_o_f(o_f)` - Sets oxidizer/fuel ratio
* `.set_phi(phi)` - Sets equivalence ratio
* `.set_r_eq(r_eq)` - Sets valence equivalence ratio

## Rocket Problem Constructor Additional Parameters:
For `RocketProblem(*, **kwargs)`
* `sup`: default 1, supersonic exit/throat area ratio
  * sup can be specified later with .set_sup
* `sub`: default None, subsonic exit/throat area ratio
  * sub can be specified later with .set_sub
* **NOTE:** sup and sub cannot be specified at the same time
* `ae_at`: alias for `sup`
  * ae_at can be specified later with .set_ae_at
* `analysis_type`: default "equilibrium", whether to use equilibrium reactions or frozen. For using frozen specify "frozen" or "frozen nfz=1" for frozen at the chamber or "frozen nfz=2" for frozen at the throat

### RocketProblem Methods
* `.set_sup(sup)` - Sets supersonic area ratio
* `.set_sub(sub)` - Sets subsonic area ratio
* `.set_ae_at(sup)` - Sets supersonic area ratio

## Available Output Dictionary Keys:
All Problem data objects are "Output" objects, which are similar to dictionaries, but can also be accessed with dot notation.

For example if you had "data = problem.run_cea()", and wanted pressure, you could do either data.p or data["p"]

In addition, all product dictionaries are also "Output" objects so to get H2O fraction, you could use data.prod_c.H2O or data["prod_c"]["H2O"] or data["prod_c"].H2O, etc.

## Using ThermoInterface
Provided with this library is an interface to the thermo_spg.inp file provided with the library. 

You can access materials as if `ThermoInterface` is a dictionary using materials' CEA Names. E.G. `ThermoInterface["CH4"]`. This object support checking for inclusion and iterations, such as `"CH4" in ThermoInterface` and `for name in ThermoInterface`. It supports dictionary methods such as `.keys()`, `.values()` and `.items()`.

The value returned by `ThermoInterface` accesses is a `ThermoMaterial object`, which is an `Output` object (dictionary that can be accessed with .dot notation) with the following keys:
* `name` - Name of the material
* `reference` - Reference, if given. Otherwise ""
* `elements` - Dictionary of element: numerical value specified
* `condensed` - True if condensed phase, False otherwise
* `mw` - Molecular weight in g/mol
* `hf` - float heat of formation at 298.15 in kJ/mol (or assigned enthalpy if 0 temp range)
* `temp_ranges` - List of two-tuples of [range start, range end] (K)
* `reactant_only` - True if material only shows up in reactants, False otherwise

### Available Methods
* `ThermoInterface.get_close_matches(name, [n])` - Gets close matches to a given material name. For example "Al(cr)" returns 'AL(cr)', 'ALN(cr)', 'Ag(cr)', 'W(cr)'. n influences the number of results returned, and is the maximum number of results returned.
* `ThermoMaterial.defined_at(temp)` - Returns True if the material is specified at the given temperature, False otherwise. Materials specified at one temperature are actually allowed at that temperature +- 10K.
