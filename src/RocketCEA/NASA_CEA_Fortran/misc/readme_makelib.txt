The makelib.f code converts the formatted form of the thermodynamic and 
transport property databases to an unformatted form for use in programs like
SUBEQ and CEA or CEA2.


A complete description for using this program is given in the comments in the
FORTRAN source program (i.e. makelib.f).  Compilers are freely available on the
internet for any computer platform.
